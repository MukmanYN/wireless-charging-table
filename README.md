# wireless-charging-table
Overview 

This project aims to design and build a wireless charging table capable of charging iPhones, iPads, and other Qi-compatible devices. The goal is to integrate a functional and efficient wireless power transmission system into a table, eliminating the need for wired charging.

Project Status

I have primarily focused on simulating the transmitter circuit in LTspice, specifically working on generating a high-frequency AC oscillation necessary for wireless power transfer. Prototyping will begin next, where I will construct and test the physical circuit.

Reflection

When selecting this project for my senior design, I did not initially consider the inherent limitations of wireless charging. I quickly realized that wireless charging has significant efficiency challenges and limitations, making it less ideal compared to wired alternatives. However, that did not stop me from moving forward. I have been designing and modifying a transmitter circuit to optimize power transfer and functionality.
